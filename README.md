## About
A nice little program to append a given line to the current shell's config file, and also to teach me rust :3

Tested with bash and zsh, should work on nsh, ksh, tcsh, ion, and fish shells as well as far as i know.

Includes a helper for the alias command, so you don't have to escape quotations, but that is good practise!
